<h3>Problem:</h3>

Marking attendance is a very simple job but even in todayâ€™s world the solution is not there to effectively mark attendance and track it.
I have seen Teachers/professors Struggle in that process 
They would first manually mark it in their attendance sheet and then upload it on database which is a very tedious and long job   

<h3>Solution:</h3>

Thus , T-Track provides with the solution to this problem where the data is directly uploaded to the Database  and No need to carry attendance sheets .
